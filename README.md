# ConvertCurrency
The Currency class converts an amount of money from a specific country into the equivalent currency of another country when the current exchange rate is given. We pick a country, find the local currency, and then convert the money value in that currency to the equivalent US dollars.

This project is supposed to convert a given amount of money in a country to the exact or equivalent currency of another country. 

          Here are the links to where I found the exchange rates:

-------------------------------PMR---------------------------------------- 
<+s>: This program allowed me to understand how to get the computer to convert a given currency from one country to the equivalent currency of another country. 
In addition,this program allowed me to know when to declare variables and when to use double and int. 

<-s>: I made a some mistakes while declaring certain variables. 
In addition, I made some mistakes with print and println statements. 
I made a few mistakes while calculating the Souvenir because I didn't get the right output. 
However, I attempted to fix my mistakes and I eventually understood. 
Overall, I enjoyed writing this program even though I needed to work on fixing a few mistakes. 
I would say that this challenge program helped me and allowed me to understand where I need to grow and what I need to pay close attention to.

In the future, I will be sure to thoroughly understand the directions before proceeding to write the program. 
In addition, I will be sure to check my print & println statements before moving on.
